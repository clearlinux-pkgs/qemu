#   CVE-2017-15124
#
#    VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) 2.11.0 and older was
#    found to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did
#    not throttle the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did
#    not consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold
#    onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause
#    DoS to the server host.
#    Fix in :

#
#    Since this code is incredibly subtle & hard to understand though, the
#    first 8 patches do a bunch of independant cleanups/refactoring to make the
#    security fixes clearer.  The last two patches are just some extra cleanup
#    / help for future maint.
#    The key patches containing the security fix are 9, 10, 11.
